<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Message from Tathagata</p>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>I have been travelling endlessly for the wishes of the human world. </p>
<p>I can tell various cases operating for the world to exist, which nobody has known so far. </p>
<p>I can tell what has existed in life and the effect of what happens in the life of individuals. </p>
<p>I am aware of the world of gods which has not been revealed by anyone.</p>
<p>I know the substance of eschatology which has been said to happen in this era. </p>
<p>I can introduce <em>'uitong'</em> which will be a new visionary medicine. <em>Uitong</em> makes diagnoses and treatments for a great number of diseases possible, without using any medicines or medical instruments. </p>
<p>I can answer to a wide range of problems in the human world and I can provide the solutions on the spot. </p>
<p>I hope that my activities will be helpful to many people and sincerely request your verification of my truth.</p>

<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>Tathagata</p>
